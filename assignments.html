                    <h2>Assignment 0: Adding two numbers</h2>
                    <p>For this first assignment, I created my own personal website. This website contains an introduction to who I am,
                         my experience, my projects, how to contact me, and the assignments I have worked on. This link takes you to a 
                         simple python script that sums two numbers and prints to the command lime the solution</p>

                    <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
                    <p>For this assignment we captured data of the elevators in CDS and their arrival times over four days. We were then asked 
                        to analyze this data and come to conclusions of the best location to stand in the elevator area to minimize walking distance
                        to each elevator. I approached this assignment by really trying to understand the different functionalities of numpy and matplotlib. 
                        From there, it was simply mathematical approaches to find the correct averages and calculations. </p>

                    <h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
                    <p>This assigment was done in order to understand the implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). I applied SVD to the MNIST dataset
                        as a preprocessing step, as a method of reducing its dimensionality before training a regression model. I saw how different
                        numbers of SVD components affected the accuracy and the training time to check for the best possible trade off between the two.

                    <h2>Assignment 5: Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I developed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict customer churn, 
                        using k=37 and the Euclidean distance metric. I performed cross-validation to evaluate the model, 
                        trained it on the full dataset, and made predictions on the test set, which was then submitted
                        onto Kaggle for a class competition of who had the highest accuracy.

                    <h2>MIDTERM</h2>
                    <p>In this midterm, we developed a predictive model for amazon movie reviews, trying to reach optimal classification
                        performance. I speak more about the challenges I faced, the decisions I made, and the lessons I learned in the write 
                        up of this assignment in this github repository.

                    <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I generated random datasets and applied linear regression to analyze how sample size and noise impact
                        the stability of regression estimates. By running simulations with varying parameters, I observed the distribution of slopes 
                        and intercepts and explored how randomness in data can lead to non-zero slopes even without a true underlying relationship. 
                        This analysis highlights the importance of sample size and noise control in producing reliable regression models.

                    <h2>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I continued building on the previous assignment of linear regression. This new web app allows users to 
                        generate simulated linear data, fit a model, and perform hypothesis tests and confidence interval calculations on the model. 
                        By adjusting different inputs, the app shows insight into how these factors influence statistical estimates and significance.
