                    <h2>Assignment 0: Adding two numbers</h2>
                    <p>For this first assignment, I created my own personal website. This website contains an introduction to who I am,
                         my experience, my projects, how to contact me, and the assignments I have worked on. This link takes you to a 
                         simple python script that sums two numbers and prints to the command lime the solution</p>

                    <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
                    <p>For this assignment we captured data of the elevators in CDS and their arrival times over four days. We were then asked 
                        to analyze this data and come to conclusions of the best location to stand in the elevator area to minimize walking distance
                        to each elevator. I approached this assignment by really trying to understand the different functionalities of numpy and matplotlib. 
                        From there, it was simply mathematical approaches to find the correct averages and calculations. </p>
